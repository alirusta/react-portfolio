# things to do for portfolio:

- fix mobile view, how to import a component at mobile viewport size?
- larger hero logo, put in background and animate like it's flying towards the navbar
- layer the hero-content offset-wise over the hero logo
- fix socials sidebar dimensions, make it larger and give it a clear margin right from the content
- implement an animation akin to the one from [OperaGX](https://www.opera.com/de/gx) for navbar
- 
##  for works component:

- add cards that utilize a parallax sidescroll effect like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkADl0HubMY)

## for skills component:

- add logo icons in a ring like marcel or add cards with neato hover effects
- for example a 3D card effect for skill cards like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-3tPXf9a7M)

## implement functionality for:

- contact per email, use [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for this
- add resume as a card that can be viewed online (new window with in-browser pdf-viewer)
- add a way for users to download resume conveniently (need database?)

### other ideas:

- turn mouse cursor into a [Luminous Orb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZIJKkwc8l8)
- add dark/light modes (different [color themes](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Klveg8tsY54) too?)

#### try out a different portfolio layout after this one is deployed, use some of the following as inspiration:

- try a super simplified portfolio that only consists of letters
- letters are modified, animated and implemented creatively to entice the viewers attention
- something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owpaafxvkjU) for starters
